We have difficulty reading doctor's prescriptions because these words are not in our vocabulary; therefore, developing a system with a limited vocabulary (containing the manufacturers and only the allowed drugs for patients) will increase the likelihood of correctly guessing the given word. The problem with reading doctor's prescriptions is that they don't use full names of the manufacturer or the drug.
